#####
# NOTES:
# 1. why do we get libicu? ANSWER: because boost.graph depends on a myriad of libs for no good reason and among them some libs require ICU.
# 2. `bdep status @common` says nothing is initialized there, which is true. I have to `bdep status @debug -r` to see the dependency tree, but right now it's unreadable.
# 3. FIXED: For that kind of setup (where we want some dependencies to be built once for all and shared), having to specify the specific versions of these special dependencies is a bit problematic for maintenance.
#    I don't know if there is a way to make bpkg work with the constraints of projects without projects being initialized? Or at least a way to fetch package with a constraint expression instead of a version?
#    SOLUTION: use `bdep build --dependency --configure-only`, the first flag makes the build command do nothing until the packages are actually used by some other project, the second makes sure we don't build yet.
